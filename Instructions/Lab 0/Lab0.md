    <span class="mark">**Note**: When you need to reference a file (a Word
    document, an Excel file, etc) into a Copilot prompt, the file MUST be
    saved in a OneDrive account. You can't link to a locally stored file
    on your PC.</span>

    1.  On the Microsoft 365 navigation pane, select OneDrive to open it.
    
    2.  Browse to the **c:\LabFiles** folder to select and upload a copy of
        the document(s) to OneDrive. **Note**: You can either choose to
        upload a copy of all the documents or the document(s) related to the
        particular lab.
