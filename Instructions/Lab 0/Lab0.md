    The Microsoft 365 app launcher is a menu of apps and services that you
    are licensed for, and opens when you select the app launcher icon on
    Microsoft365 page. The App launcher makes opening and switching
    between your apps easy by highlighting your recently used apps, and
    providing quick access to your recent online Office documents.
