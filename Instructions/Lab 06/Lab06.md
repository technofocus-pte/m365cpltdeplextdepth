# Lab 06: Empower your workforce – Copilot – HR

## Objective:

With Copilot for Microsoft 365 HR professionals can streamline their
workflow and enhance their productivity in their core business processes
such as recruitment, onboarding, performance management, employee
engagement and compliance management.

In this lab, you will use:

- Copilot in Word to create a job description for a new role.

- Copilot in Word to analyze multiple resumes and provide a report
  comparing the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate, rank the
  candidates from most qualified to least, and make a recommendation.

- Copilot in Loop to create a set of interview questions for
  interviewing candidates for this role.

## Exercise #1: Create a job description using Copilot in Word

As the HR Manager at Graphic Design Institute, you started the hiring
process for a new Senior Animation Designer. Your staff created a
document that outlines all the job responsibilities for this role. In
this exercise you will use Copilot in Word to create a job description
based on the role responsibilities in this document.

1.  Open a new browser tab in the lab VM and enter the following
    URL: **<https://www.office.com>**.
    
    **Note**: If you already have a Microsoft 365 tab open in your Edge browser, then select it now.

2.  On the **Microsoft 365** navigation pane, select **OneDrive** to open it. 
    
3.  Browse to the **C:\LabFiles** folder to select and upload a copy of **Graphic Design
    Institute - Design Team** document to **OneDrive**

    **Tip**: Open and close the file to get it in your Most Recently Used (MRU) file list.
    
    ![](./media/image1.png)
    
    **Note**: If you have already uploaded all the lab assets to OneDrive as suggested in **Preparing for the lab
    execution** section you can skip this step.
  
4.  If you have a Microsoft 365 tab open in your Microsoft Edge browser,
    then select it now; otherwise, open a new tab and enter the
    following URL: [**https://www.office.com**](https://www.office.com/)

5.  In **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Microsoft Word**,and then open a blank
    document.

6.  In the **Draft with Copilot** window, enter the following prompt,
    but don't select the **Generate** button until after you link the
    responsibilities file to the prompt in the next step:

    **I'm the HR Manager at the Graphic Design Institute. We've currently
    started the hiring process for a new Senior Animation Designer. Please
    review the attached document that outlines the job responsibilities
    for this role and create a job description based on those
    responsibilities**.

7.  You now must attach to the prompt the **Graphic Design Institute -
    Design Team Responsibilities.docx** file that you downloaded. In
    the **Draft with Copilot** window, select the **Reference your
    content** button. In the drop-down menu that appears, if
    the **Graphic Design Institute - Design Team
    Responsibilities.docx** file appears in the list of files, select
    it.

    ![](./media/image2.png)

8.  Select **Browse files from cloud**, select the file from
    the **Recent** file list, and then select the **Attach** button. If
    the file doesn't appear in the **Recent** file list, select **My
    files** at the top of the navigation pane in the **Pick a
    file** window, navigate to the folder where you stored the file,
    select the file and then select **Attach**.

    ![](./media/image3.png)

9.  Note how the file is displayed in the prompt and
    select **Generate**.

    ![](./media/image4.png)

10.  Review the first draft of the job description document.

    ![](./media/image5.png)

11. You note that it doesn't include many of the details found in the
    job responsibilities document. Instead, it provides a summarized
    sentence or two for each responsibility. To correct this
    shortcoming, enter the following prompt and select the forward
    arrow:

    **While this job description draft is a good start, you failed to
    include most of the details found in the job responsibilities
    document. Please try again, and this time outline each responsibility
    area and select the responsibilities required of a Senior Animation
    Designer**.

    ![](./media/image6.png)

12. Review the second draft.

    ![](./media/image7.png)

13. Again, you feel that Copilot should provide more details. Enter the
    following prompt to see if you can get it to be more specific:

    **This job description draft is better, but it still lacks the details
    that I'm looking for. The job responsibilities document outlined
    detailed responsibilities for each area. Include those details in this
    job description. Be as specific as you can**.

14. After reviewing the results, you're reminded of the saying, "Be
    careful what you wish for" The list of responsibilities in this
    third draft is long; in fact, maybe too long for a workable job
    description document. At this point, you want to review the previous
    drafts to see if the earlier ones are maybe preferable to this
    longer one. In the Copilot window, just above the prompt field, note
    the draft of the current version of the document. In this case,
    you're on draft 3 of 3. To review an earlier draft, select the
    backward arrow (\<) to go back to the second and then first drafts.
    Use the forward arrows (\>) to go back to the latest drafts.

    ![](./media/image8.png)

    ![](./media/image9.png)

    In this case, go back to the second draft. Review the list of
    responsibilities again. While it's not as extensive as the list in the
    third draft, it looks cleaner and still provides sufficient
    information for a job candidate to understand what is expected of them
    in this Senior Animation Designer role. You decide that the second
    draft is preferable to the final draft, so you elect to use this one.
    In the Copilot window, select the **Keep it** button.

15. You're ready to move forward with this job description document, so
    save it to your OneDrive account with the file name of **Graphic
    Design Institute - Job descriptions.docx.**

    ![](./media/image10.png)

    <span class="mark">**Note:** It's important that you save this
    document since you will be using it in the next exercise.</span>

## Exercise #2: Analyze resumes and make a recommendation using Copilot in Word

In the previous exercise, you learned how Copilot in Word can assist HR
professionals in crafting a job description. In this exercise, you will
learn how you can automate the initial stages of the resume screening
process to quickly identify the most suitable candidates from large
pools of applicants.

<span class="mark">**Note**: When you ask Copilot to generate a document
or apply some type of change, it may sometimes start to display the
draft and then stop. If this situation happens to you, select
the **Regenerate** button to have it generate a new draft, or rephrase
your prompt and try again.</span>

![](./media/image11.png)

As the HR Manager at Graphic Design Institute, you started receiving
resumes from probable candidate for a new Senior Animation Designer
position based on the job posting on the web and the company's internal
employee website. You will now use Copilot in Word to screen a batch of
resumes that you received for the role and provide a recommendation as
to which of the candidates qualifies for a job interview.

At the end of the previous exercise, you saved the job description file
that you created. You were instructed to save the file as **Graphic
Design Institute - Job descriptions.docx**. If it is saved with a
different file name, then remember the name that you used so that you
can locate the file in this exercise.

1.  Open a new browser tab in the lab VM and enter the following
    URL: **<https://www.office.com>**.
    
    **Note**: If you already have a Microsoft 365 tab open in your Edge browser, then select it now.

2.  On the **Microsoft 365** navigation pane, select **OneDrive** to open it..

3.  Browse to the **C:\LabFiles** folder to select and upload a copy of the following documents to **OneDrive**,
    - **Resume - Patti Fernandez**
    - **Resume - Nestor Wilke**
    - **Resume - Holly Dickson**
    - **Resume - Alex Wilber** .
    
    **Note**: If you have already uploaded all the lab assets to OneDrive as suggested in **Preparing for the lab
    execution** you can skip this step.
    
5.  In this exercise, you access the documents from the Most Recently
    Used (MRU) file list. To get the files to appear in the MRU list,
    open each document and then close it. Open and close each of the
    four resume files in your OneDrive account.

    [](./media/image12.png)

6.  In **Microsoft 365**, open **Microsoft Word**, and then open a new
    blank document.

7.  In the **Draft with Copilot** window that appears at the top of the
    blank document, enter the following prompt, but don't submit the
    prompt just yet. You must attach the files to the prompt in the next
    step:

    **I'm the Hiring Manager for Graphic Design Institute. We're hiring
    for the position of Senior Animation Designer. Please create a report
    that compares the attached resumes to the requirements for a Senior
    Animation Designer in the attached job description file and rank the
    candidates from most qualified to least qualified. Thank you!**
    
    ![](./media/image13.png)

6.  You now must attach to the prompt the **Graphic Design Institute -
    Job descriptions.docx** file that you saved to your OneDrive account
    at the end of the prior exercise. In the **Draft with
    Copilot** window, select the **Reference your content** button. In
    the drop-down menu that appears, if the job description file appears
    in the list of files, select it. Otherwise, select **Browse files
    from cloud**, locate the job description file that you saved to your
    OneDrive account in the prior exercise, and then select
    the **Attach** button. Note how the file is displayed in the prompt.

7.  Repeat the prior step for each of the four resumes that you
    downloaded. Note what happens when you attempt to attach the third
    resume. Copilot displays a message indicating that you can only
    include up to three files to a prompt. Since you had to include the
    job description file that provides Copilot with the job
    requirements, you can only submit two of the resumes with this
    initial prompt.

    ![](./media/image14.png)

8.  Since you attached the job description file and the first two
    resumes to the prompt, select **Generate**. At this point, Copilot
    extracts the pertinent information from the job description file and
    the first two resumes and creates a Resume Comparison report. At
    this point, you're in Copilot draft mode.

9.  Review the results of this first draft.

    ![](./media/image15.png)

    **Note**: Take a look at the **Draft with Copilot** window and note
    that it doesn't include an **Attach** button. Once you're in draft
    mode like you currently are, Copilot doesn't allow you to attach any
    more files to subsequent prompts. You can use the prompt field to
    modify the document, but you can no longer attach another file. Keep
    this requirement in mind as you proceed through the next steps. This
    current draft only compares the first two resumes. To compare the
    remaining two resumes to the two that are in the current draft, you
    must keep a draft of this report, and then create a second report that
    compares the two remaining resumes to the document that you just
    created.

10. You're now looking at the first draft of the report that compares
    the first two resumes to the job description file. Copilot gives you
    the ability to regenerate however many drafts you want until you
    find one that you prefer. Even if you think this first draft looks
    okay, select the **Regenerate** button in the **Draft with
    Copilot** window to have Copilot create a second draft.

    ![](./media/image16.png)

11. When regenerating, you may come across the “Something went wrong”
    error message. Dismiss and try regenerating the comparison report
    until you get the regenerated report.

<!-- -->

10. Review the second draft that Copilot created. In the real world, you
    can repeat this process until you're satisfied with a specific
    draft. If you want to go back to a previous draft to compare it to a
    more recent draft, select the forward (\>) and backward (\<) arrows
    to go back and forth through the drafts. Compare the two drafts that
    you created and make sure the one you prefer is displayed (it will
    either be **1 of 2** or **2 of 2**). When you find a draft that you
    want to use, select the **Keep it** button.

    ![](./media/image17.png)

    **Note**: When you select **Keep it**, Copilot moves from draft mode
    into normal Microsoft Word mode. It also automatically saves
    the **Report Comparison** document to your OneDrive account.

11. You're now ready to have Copilot review the final two resumes.
    However, as the earlier step indicated, you must compare the
    remaining two resumes to the **Report Comparison** document that you
    just created that compared the first two resumes. To do so, you must
    open a new Word document. Since you're still in the **Word** tab in
    your browser with the current **Report Comparison** document being
    displayed, select **File** in the menu above the **Word** ribbon,
    and then on the **Home** page, select **Blank document** under
    the **New** section. Doing so opens a new tab in your browser along
    with a new Word document.

12. In the **Draft with Copilot** window, enter the following prompt,
    but don't submit it. You must attach the remaining two resume files
    and the first **Report Comparison** report to the prompt in the next
    step:

    **That was a good start. Please create a report that compares the
    attached resumes to the prior resume comparison report (attached) and
    rank the candidates from most qualified to least qualified. Thank
    you!**

13. You now must attach the report that you just created that compared
    the first two resumes, along with the remaining two resumes. After
    entering the prompt in the prior step, select the **Reference your
    content** button in the **Draft with Copilot** window. In the
    drop-down menu that appears, the **Report Comparison of
    Resumes** document that you created should appear at the top of the
    file list. Select this document.

14. In the **Draft with Copilot** window, select the **Reference your
    content** button. In the drop-down menu that appears, you need to
    attach one of the remaining two resumes. If you see one of the files
    in the file list, then select it. Otherwise, select **Browse files
    from cloud**, locate one of the remaining two resumes (you should
    see it if you scroll through the **Recent** file list), select it,
    and then select the **Attach** button. Repeat this process to select
    the final remaining resume.

    ![](./media/image18.png)

15. Once you have the first Report Comparison report and the remaining
    two resumes attached to the prompt, select the **Generate** button
    in the **Draft with Copilot** window.

    **Note**: When generating comparison reports with successive resumes,
    you may come across the “Something went wrong” error message. Dismiss
    and try generating the comparison report until you get the report.

16. Copilot should compare the first two resumes and the final two
    resumes and provide a rank list of the candidates. At this point,
    you could regenerate a new draft or ask Copilot to make any changes.
    For this training exercise, you decide you're satisfied with the
    report, so select the **Keep it** button.

    ![](./media/image19.png)

17. At this point, Copilot generated two Report Comparison documents,
    the second of which is the final report comparing all four
    candidates. Keep this scenario in mind if you must do something
    similar in the real-world using Copilot in Word. You can close this
    tab in your Microsoft Edge browser.

## Exercise #3: Create interview questions using Copilot in Loop

With Copilot in Loop, you can create workspaces and pages, use
intelligent search and templates to add relevant content, and share your
work with others. Copilot in Loop can suggest ideas and help start
projects, making it easier to get going when you find yourself stuck. It
can draft texts, create tables, and even answer questions quickly.

Copilot in Loop can assist HR professionals through many aspects of the
HR experience - from the hiring process, to managing employees, to
handling important documents, to managing internal communications.

In this exercise, you will use Copilot in Loop to help with the hiring
process for a new role. While you used Copilot in Word in the previous
exercise to screen resumes, you will use Copilot in Loop to create a
list of interview questions for the top candidates. During this
exercise, you can check whether Copilot in Loop can amend the list of
questions based on your direction.

1.  If you have **Microsoft 365** open in a tab, then proceed to the
    next step. Otherwise, open a new tab in your **Microsoft
    Edge** browser, and then enter the following
    URL: [**https://www.office.com**](https://www.office.com/)

2.  In **Microsoft 365**, select **Loop** if it appears in the left-hand
    navigation pane. If it doesn't appear there, then select **Explore
    Apps**, and on the **Apps** page, scroll down to locate **Loop** and
    then select it.

    ![](./media/image20.png)

3.  If you see the **Sign-in** button, sign-in using the user
    credentials.

    ![](./media/image21.png)

    **Note**: After signing in, close the Loop browser window and once
    again open Loop from the Apps page.

4.  In **Microsoft Loop**, the **Workspaces** tab is displayed by
    default. You want to create a new workspace for this project,
    select **+** next to **Getting started**, and then select **+New
    workspace** button.

    ![](./media/image22.png)

5.  In the **Create a new workspace** window, enter **Interview
    questions** for your workspace name, and then select either
    the **Continue** or **Create** button that appears (depending on
    your Loop version).

6.  In the **Add files to your workspace** window (depending on your
    version of Loop, this window may say **Workspace Switcher**),
    select **Create workspace**.

7.  You're now in the first page for your new workspace. The name of the
    page is currently **Untitled**. Note the page (Untitled) also
    appears in the left-hand navigation pane. In the main body of the
    page, select in the **Untitled** field and change the name of the
    page to: **15 interview questions for the Senior Animation Designer
    role**. Note how the page name is automatically updated in the
    navigation pane.

    ![](./media/image23.png)

8.  In the **Just start typing...** field, enter a forward
    slash **(/)**.

    ![](./media/image24.png)

9.  In the drop-down menu that appears, under the **Copilot** section at
    the top of the menu, select **Draft page content**.

10. In the **Copilot** window that appears, enter the following prompt
    and select the **Submit** icon:

    **Create a list of the 15 best interview questions that should be
    asked to candidates applying for a new Senior Animation Designer role
    at the Graphic Design Institute**.

    ![](./media/image25.png)

    <span class="mark">**Note**: Sometimes, you may not see the
    **Copilot** window with Create, Brainstorm, Blueprint and Describe
    options. If you are experiencing such exceptions, close the workspace
    and try once again.</span>

11. Review the list of questions.

    ![](./media/image26.png)

12. You feel this initial list is a good start, but you notice a few
    types of questions are missing. In the Copilot pane that appears,
    enter the following prompt:

    **Add a question about having failed at a project and what they
    learned from it**.
    
    ![](./media/image27.png)

13. Review the new question that Loop created.

    ![](./media/image28.png)

14. After scanning the list one last time, you realize that it includes
    few, if any questions about leadership. To correct this situation,
    enter the following prompt:

    **As a Senior Animation Designer, the candidate is expected to lead
    their design team on projects. Ask them to talk about a couple of
    their most significant experiences in leading other design team
    members, and what their leadership style is**.
    
    ![](./media/image29.png)

15. Note what happened in Loop. When you request a change without
    specifically asking it to update the current page, Copilot may open
    a new page and make the change there rather than in the current
    page, as it did in the prior prompt. When it does so, note how in
    the Copilot pane it tracks the prompts, with the most recent prompt
    appearing at the top of the pane.

    Select a previous prompt. Note how the content on the page appears in
    a lighter font. Also attempt to select the **Rewrite with
    Copilot** prompt field. Copilot disables this field since it's not the
    current page. The current page is also referred to as the active page.
    Now select the latest prompt and note how the content is clear,
    indicating this page is the current, or active page. You can only
    amend the active page, which is why on this page, you can select into
    the **Rewrite with Copilot** prompt field.
    
    ![](./media/image30.png)

16. Let's make one more change. You're unsure as to whether the current
    list of questions is sufficient. To play it safe, you decide to ask
    Copilot in Loop to recommend some more questions. Enter the
    following prompt:

    **Are there any other questions that you think should be added to the
    list?**

17. Note the final list of questions that Copilot in Loop generated.

    ![](./media/image31.png)

18. You now have a vast assortment of questions to choose from when
    interviewing your candidates. And with Loop, you know that others on
    your HR team can see these questions in real-time on the same Loop
    component, even if they're using different apps and devices.

## Summary:
