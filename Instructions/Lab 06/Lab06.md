**Objective**

In this lab, you will learn how to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat
with a Declarative Agent made using Microsoft Copilot Studio.  You will
also learn to add a custom action to the agent that you made.

Estimated duration – 45 minutes

## Exercise 1: Creating a Power Platform environment

With the Power Platform, you can create different environments and
easily switch between them accordingly to your needs. An environment
stores apps, flows, data, agents, etc. and each environment is
completely isolated from any other environment. In this exercise, you
will create a new dedicated environment in which you will perform the
remaining exercises and tasks.

1.  Open a browser and, using your login credentials from the
    **Resources** tab, go
    to +++https://admin.powerplatform.com+++.
