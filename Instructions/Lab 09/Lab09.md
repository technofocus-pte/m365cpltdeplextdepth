# Lab 9 - Streamlining IT Support Operations with Autonomous Copilot Agent using Copilot Studio

**Estimate Time: 60 mins**

**Objective**

The objective of this lab is to enable participants to streamline IT
support operations at Contoso Solutions by creating an autonomous
Copilot agent. Participants will learn to set up Microsoft Copilot
Studio, configure the IT Support Agent, integrate Power Apps and
Dataverse, enhance the bot’s capabilities with a knowledge base, and
automate ticket creation using Power Automate. This hands-on lab will
equip users with the skills to improve IT workflows, reduce manual
effort, and enhance support efficiency.

**Solution**

Participants will create a customized Contoso IT Support Agent using
Microsoft Copilot Studio, configure it to handle common IT issues, and
integrate it with Dataverse for storing support data. They will set up a
development environment, add knowledge sources, and refine the bot's
conversation flows for better user interaction. By leveraging Power
Apps, participants will create a Dataverse table to manage IT support
records. Using Power Automate, they will automate ticket creation and
email notifications for unresolved issues. Finally, participants will
test the agent to validate its troubleshooting accuracy and workflow
automation, ensuring seamless IT support operations.

## Exercise 1: Getting Started with Power Apps

8.  In this case, there is one support ticket detail in the tracker,
    which gets added to the Dataverse table hence creating a support
    ticket for the user.

9.  An Email generation on receiving an email from a user regarding any
    issue will be more appropriate. The email configuration part could
    not be done here due to the tenant permission restrictions. Consider
    the next Task, if you have a tenant with the permissions.

## Task to be done in production environment

In a production environment, the support ticket generation will be
mainly mail based.

**Final Conclusion of the Lab Guide**

This lab guide provided participants with a hands-on experience in
deploying an Autonomous Copilot Agent for Contoso Solutions' IT support
service desk. By following the step-by-step exercises, participants were
able to:

1.  **Set Up Copilot Studio**: Participants learned how to log into
    Copilot Studio, create and configure the IT support agent, and
    enable essential settings like generative AI and orchestrator for
    effective troubleshooting and ticket automation.

2.  **Navigate Power Apps**: Participants gained practical knowledge in
    logging into Power Apps, setting up a Dataverse table, and importing
    data from Excel to track and manage support tickets efficiently.

3.  **Enhance Bot Capabilities**: The exercises focused on adding a
    knowledge base to the bot, customizing the conversation start and
    fallback topics to improve user interaction, and ensuring the bot
    could handle a wide range of IT support scenarios.

4.  **Automate IT Support Tasks**: Participants also learned how to
    automate the creation of support tickets using Power Automate,
    enhancing the bot's capability to manage unresolved issues and
    improve IT team workflows.

By completing these exercises, participants were able to implement a
robust autonomous support system that improves response times, reduces
manual workload, and enhances overall productivity for IT support
operations. The integration of Copilot Studio, Power Apps, and Dataverse
ensures a seamless flow of information, automates routine tasks, and
optimizes support workflows, providing immediate troubleshooting
solutions to employees and automated ticket management for unresolved
