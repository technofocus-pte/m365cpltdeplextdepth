# Lab 09: Build an autonomous agent to track new files created in OneDrive

**Introduction**

OneDrive For Business of an organization has been getting multiple files
created in it and it has become difficult for the admin to keep track of
them.

**Objective**

Build an autonomous agent to enter the details of the newly added file
to the File Details tracker. This resolves the issue of tracking the
file additions and the File details tracker will have the details of all
the newly created files.

### Task 4: Publish the trigger

1.  Back in the Copilot Studio, select **Settings**.

    ![](./media/image32.png)

2.  Select **Generative AI** -> **Using generative AI in conversations**. Select **Generative (preview)**

### Task 5: Test the trigger

1.  Navigate back to the **OneDrive** in the browser. Click on **+** and

    ![](./media/image39.png)

4.  Add few more files similarly.

5.  Now, **open** the **File details.xlsx** from OneDrive and observe that the
    details of the files created are added to the tracker.
    **Note**: Login using your credentials from the Resources tab as requried. 

    ![](./media/image40.png)

7.  When the file is created in OneDrive, the trigger is invoked which
    in turn executes the flow **When a file is added** and updates the
    tracker.

8.  You can also check the details of the autonomous agent in the
    Activity tab in Copilot Studio.

**Summary**

In this lab, we have learnt to create, publish and test an autonomous
agent from Copilot Studio.
